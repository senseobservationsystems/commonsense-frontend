            This lists all available sensors, physical as well as virtual.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage group memberships: </strong>
            Join a group to share data or to make use of data shared by others</li>
            <li><strong>Manage states: </strong>
            This advanced feature lets you add state sensors.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage environments: </strong>
            This sections allows you to indicate that one or more sensors belong to a certain location.</li>
        </ul>

     <h2>This panel</h2>

        <h2>Comparing sensors</h2>
